# Dynamic-sorting-and-assignment-of-resources-in-a-parking-lot-system
We're heading toward a day when autonomous electric vehicles will be common. These cars have high processing capabilities as they are required to make split second decisions. These resources can be put to better use while they're idle in a parking lot. The services provided by the buildings nearby can be offloaded onto the EVs with valid consent. The different services that can be offloaded include:
1. Computational services so as the reduce the load on buildings and reduce the latency
2. Using the batteries of the EVs to store electricity produced from solar panels
3. Using the electricity stored in the EVs to provide for the buildings' needs if and when required 

In exchange for their services, the EVs would receive incentives. Money-based incentives or free EV solar panel charging are two possible forms of incentives. Our project's goal was to optimize the profits of all the buildings by allocating entering EVs with a parking spot among multiple parking lots under a single parking lot operator.
The aim of the project was to show that edge computing can be used for latency reduction. Raspberry Pi 3B was used for hardware implementation and Python was used for software implementation.
